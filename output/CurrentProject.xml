<!-- 
    Use this file to specify the path to the current project definition file.

    The path can be specified in two ways:
    1) A relative path (with respect to the location of the repository)
    2) Platform specific paths.
    A relative path will be prefered, unless it is empty. Relative paths will work on windows and unix
systems, even when using unix-style forward slashes for path seperation.

    Example for Windows #1:
    <windows_path>..\MyProject.oi</windows_path>
    Example for Windows #2:
    <windows_path>C:\OpenInSAR\ExampleProject.oi</windows_path>
    Example for Windows #3:
    <windows_path>\\rds.imperial.ac.uk\rds\user\saa116\ephemeral\dungeness.oi</windows_path>
    Example for Unix:
    <windows_path>\\rds.imperial.ac.uk\rds\user\saa116\ephemeral\dungeness.oi</windows_path>

<current_project>
    <!-- Path of the '.oi' project file relative to this file, CurrentProject.xml -->
    <relative_path>../../projects/insardatastore/ephemeral/$USERNAME/Folkestone.xml</relative_path>
    <!-- If for some reason you cannot use a relative path, you can use a platform-dependant
    absolute path -->
    <!-- <windows_path>.\path\relative\to\here</windows_path> -->
    <!-- Depending on what system you use, the path will likely differ. -->
    <!-- <unix_path>./path/relative/to/here</unix_path> -->
